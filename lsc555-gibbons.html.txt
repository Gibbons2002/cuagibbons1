HTML Exercise
Once you completed the HTML document, now you need to save this text file as an HTML
file format. Choose “File” on the menu bar,  Then select “Save as.”
When you see a save option, select a location to save your file (maybe, Desktop). Then, as
shown below, choose “Save as type” to Text Document (.txt) which will be a default
option.
Then, name your file as “lsc555-yourlastname.html” which yourlastname is your real last
name like syn. All lower case. No space on the file name is preferred. (If there is a space,
browsers will insert a special character which a user may have a hard time to recognize the
file name.) Then, click on “Save” button to save it.
Make sure your final name ends with
.html file extension.
E.g., lsc555-syn.html
Uncheck "if no extensions use .txt"
NOTE: For MAC users
For those who use Mac computers for creating HTML, please follow the following steps.
1. Open TextEdit and create the HTML file.
2. Go to Format and select "Make Plain Text".
3. Select File  Save As and add .html to the file name. 4. In the save as type make sure it is Unicode UTF 8.
5. Save the file and open it in the Browser. like the note pad.
You see the web file and can reveal the source code just
You have to make sure that you are setting the format as "plain text" and save as "html." Also note
that TextEdit changes standard quotation marks to "curly" quotation marks automatically and this
causes a problem in HTML/XML even in Plain Text. There is an option to turn off "smart quotes" in
preferences which solves the issue.
